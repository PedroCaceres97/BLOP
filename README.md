BLOP – Bizarre Logic & Odd Procedures

Long ago, in the dawn of digital chaos, a nameless programmer faced an eternal problem:
"Where do I put the code that doesn’t fit anywhere else?"

The answer was forged in the dark, coffee-fueled hours of a late 90’s night — a strange, resilient, and utterly unnecessary collection of functions. This was the birth of BLOP.

Some say BLOP stands for Bizarre Logic & Odd Procedures.
Others claim it’s just the sound your brain makes when it runs out of stack space.
The truth has been lost to corrupted hard drives and mysterious Git commits.

BLOP is not a framework.
BLOP is not a standard.
BLOP is the drawer of the programming world — a place where unrelated, eccentric, and occasionally useful code fragments live together in questionable harmony.

Its modules have no clear relation.
Its functions have no unified purpose.
Yet, BLOP has survived countless rewrites, refactors, and total project failures.

BLOP is eternal.
BLOP is inevitable.
BLOP… just works.
