BLOP – Bizarre Logic \& Odd Procedures

{\itshape A collection of header-\/only modules nobody asked for, but everyone deserves.}\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Begginings}{Begginings}}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md5}
{\itshape “\+Long ago, in the dark ages of computing, there was only chaos.} {\itshape Code was scattered, functions wandered aimlessly, and programmers wept.} {\itshape Then came BLOP — a mysterious artifact, forged in the fires of \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}.countless debug sessions.\+”}

BLOP is not just a library. It is {\bfseries{The Library}} — a timeless collection of completely unrelated modules, gathered over decades (or maybe hours, no one knows) by developers who refused to let their strange, misplaced code die.

Some say BLOP was discovered on a dusty floppy disk labeled “\+DO NOT OPEN.\+” Others claim it was generated by a rogue AI in 1983. All we know is this\+: BLOP has survived operating system wars, language trends, and at least one full rewrite in C for reasons still unknown.

Some also say BLOP stands for Bizarre Logic \& Odd Procedures. Others also claim it’s just the sound your brain makes when it runs out of stack space. The truth has been lost to corrupted hard drives and mysterious Git commits.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Purpose}{Purpose}}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md6}
BLOP has no singular purpose. It exists to store everything that doesn’t belong anywhere else\+: algorithms you can’t categorize, functions you wrote at 3 AM, and utilities so oddly specific they’ll probably never be used again. Yet somehow, BLOP always finds a way to be useful.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Core Principles}{Core Principles}}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md7}
1) Embrace the Weird – No function is too strange for BLOP. 2) Zero Tolerance on errors -\/ Every error produces program to stop. 3) Survive Anything – BLOP will outlive you, me, and possibly the internet.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Warning}{Warning}}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md8}
BLOP does not follow modern software design principles. BLOP is a principle — one of pure, unfiltered usefulness wrapped in absurdity. If you add to BLOP, you’re part of its history. Forever.

NO THREAD-\/\+SAFETY IMPLEMENTED (FOR NOW)\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Installation}{Installation}}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md9}
There are many ways to obtain BLOP. None of them are officially supported.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item The Traditional Way\+:
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Clone the repository like any mortal would\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{git\ clone\ https://github.com/you/BLOP.git}

\end{DoxyCode}
 Then, include the header of your choosing and hope for the best.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item The Forbidden Way\+:
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Download a random .zip file labeled blop\+\_\+final\+\_\+\+FINAL\+\_\+v2.\+zip from an obscure forum. This may or may not summon undefined behavior (literally).


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item The Ancient Way\+:
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Carve the source code onto a stone tablet and compile it with sheer willpower. Results may vary depending on compiler and geological conditions.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Usage}{Usage}}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md10}
To use BLOP, simply include one of its headers\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{preprocessor}{\#include\ <\mbox{\hyperlink{blop_8h}{blop/blop.h}}>}}

\end{DoxyCode}
 Then, call a function whose purpose even you don’t fully understand\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{blop\_doSomethingWeird();}

\end{DoxyCode}


If it compiles, congratulations — you are now part of the BLOP legacy. If it doesn’t, that’s just BLOP testing your resolve. Remember\+: BLOP doesn’t produce errors, it produces challenges.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md11}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Uninstallation}{Uninstallation}}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md11}
You don’t uninstall BLOP.

It uninstalls you.
